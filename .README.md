# A Beginner Rust Project to Replicate a Simple Grep

Not much else to say for now. A learning experience.

Hoping to learn:

- I/O with Rust
- Software Design in Rust
- Automated Testing in Rust
- How to make use of Rust built in data structures.
- How to have fun learning a brand new programming language.
